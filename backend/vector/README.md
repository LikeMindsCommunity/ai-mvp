# Vector Services

This directory contains services for managing vector databases and semantic search capabilities.

## Components

### Document Vector Services

The docs directory contains services for document vectors:

- **Vector Store Manager**: Manages ChromaDB operations for documents
- **Query Engine**: Performs semantic search on document vectors
- **Indexing Service**: Creates and updates document indices
- **Analytics Service**: Provides usage metrics for document vectors

### Code Vector Services

The code directory contains services for code vectors:

- **Vector Store Manager**: Manages ChromaDB operations for code
- **Query Engine**: Performs semantic search on code vectors
- **Indexing Service**: Creates and updates code indices
- **Analytics Service**: Provides usage metrics for code vectors

## Implementation Plan

- Create hybrid search capabilities
- Set up vector caching
- Implement batch operations

### Week 3: Analytics and Optimization
- Create analytics services
- Implement query optimization
- Set up index optimization
- Add performance monitoring

### Week 4: Integration and Scaling
- Integrate with processor services
- Set up vector store replication
- Implement sharding strategies
- Create backup and recovery procedures

## Technology Stack

# Infrastructure Services

This directory contains shared infrastructure services that support the entire backend system.

## Components

### Observability

The observability directory contains services for monitoring, tracing, and logging:

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus-based metrics
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry implementation
- **Centralized Logging**: Log aggregation
- **LLM Monitoring**: Helicone integration

### Messaging

The messaging directory contains services for asynchronous communication:

- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ client implementation
- **Event Bus**: Publish-subscribe patterns
- **Dead Letter Handling**: Failed message processing

### Authentication

The authentication directory contains services for security:

- **User Management**: User account services
- **Token Services**: JWT token handling
- **Permission Management**: Role-based access control

- Create authentication middleware
- Add comprehensive logging

### Week 4: Optimization
- Optimize messaging patterns
- Add rate limiting
- Implement connection pooling

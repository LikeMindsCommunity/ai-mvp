## Service Responsibility Matrix

| Service Group | Team Members | Key Dependencies | Priority |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| API Gateway | TBD | None | P0 |
| Service Registry | TBD | Infrastructure | P0 |
| Agent Services | TBD | Message Broker, Vector Services | P1 |
| Processor Services | TBD | Storage Services | P1 |
| Vector Services | TBD | Storage Services | P0 |
| Project Services | TBD | Agent Services, Processor Services | P2 |
| Shared Infrastructure | TBD | None | P0 |

## Critical Path Items

1. Infrastructure setup (Week 1)
2. Core service framework (Week 2)
3. Vector services implementation (Week 5)
4. Agent core framework (Week 7)
5. Documentation agent (Week 8)
6. Coding agent (Week 9)
7. End-to-end workflow testing (Week 12)

## Development Approach

- Implement horizontal slices of functionality for early testing
- Prioritize core retrieval and agent services
- Employ feature flags for progressive rollout
- Daily integration of components
- Weekly review of architecture compliance

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| LLM API instability | Implement retry logic and fallback models |
| Performance bottlenecks | Early profiling and optimization |
| Integration complexity | Service contract testing and mocks |
| Security vulnerabilities | Regular scanning and peer reviews |
| Scope creep | Strict prioritization and MVP definition |

## Definition of Done

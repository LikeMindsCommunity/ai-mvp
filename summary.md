# Project Architecture & Auth/Session Summary

## 1. Project Structure

- **api/domain/**: Pydantic models and interfaces for each module (auth, users, projects, etc.)
- **api/infrastructure/**: Service logic for each module (auth, users, projects, etc.)
- **api/presentation/**: FastAPI route handlers (thin, only request/response logic)
- **api/config.py**: Centralized settings and environment variable management
- **api/infrastructure/database.py**: Supabase client setup and caching

## 2. Authentication & Session Approach

- **Authentication**: Stateless JWT-based, using Supabase Auth for user management and token validation.
- **get_current_user**: FastAPI dependency that validates JWT and fetches user from Supabase.
- **No explicit session management**: No server-side session table, session listing, or multi-device tracking. Logout is handled by the client discarding the token.

## 3. What the MVP Covers

- Secure, scalable, and simple authentication for users via Supabase.
- Modular, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns:
  - Models in `domain/`
  - Business logic in `infrastructure/`
  - API routes in `presentation/`
- Project and user profile management via Supabase tables and RPCs.
- Ready for multi-user, multi-project workflows.

## 4. When to Revisit Session Management

- If you need to support "log out from all devices" or session invalidation.
- If you want to track user activity or device logins.
- If you want to implement refresh tokens for longer-lived sessions.
- If you need advanced security features (e.g., admin session control, audit logs).

## 5. Next Steps / Recommendations

- Add unit and integration tests for all endpoints and services.
- Document the API (OpenAPI/Swagger, usage examples).
- Add rate limiting and security hardening for production.
- Consider session management and refresh tokens if/when you need advanced auth features.
- Continue to keep route files thin and business logic in services for maintainability.

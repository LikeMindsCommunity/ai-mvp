# Project Context

This project is an AI-powered **LikeMinds Flutter Integration Assistant** that helps developers integrate LikeMinds Chat and Feed SDKs into Flutter applications.

## System Overview

The overall system is described in [docs/plans/ed.md](mdc:docs/plans/ed.md) with a clean architecture pattern:
- `api/` - Main backend application (FastAPI)
- `flutter_generator/` - Python utilities for Flutter/Dart code handling
- `integration/` - Template Flutter project
- `output/` - Generated artifacts
- `agent_system/` - New module implementing the multi-agent architecture

## Current Architecture Summary

[docs/plans/summary.md](mdc:docs/plans/summary.md) describes the current architecture:
- **api/domain/**: Pydantic models and interfaces
- **api/infrastructure/**: Service logic
- **api/presentation/**: FastAPI route handlers
- Authentication: Stateless JWT-based, using Supabase Auth

## The Agent System

The `agent_system` module will be the new intelligent core that replaces the existing `flutter_generator` module with a robust, performant, and modular multi-agent system based on the Agno framework.

The system must maintain compatibility with the existing API layer, particularly the WebSocket interface in `api/presentation/websocket_handler.py`.

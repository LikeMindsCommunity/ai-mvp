# Implementation Workflow

The implementation is broken down into phases and tasks in [docs/plans/multi-agent-tasks.md](mdc:docs/plans/multi-agent-tasks.md).

## Task Guidelines

1. **Focus on Single Tasks**: Only work on the specific task mentioned by the user. Do not implement multiple tasks at once or get ahead of the sequence.

2. **Follow the Phase Sequence**: Tasks are organized in phases (0-6). Later phases depend on earlier ones, so follow the sequence.

3. **Respect Task Scope**:
   - Small (S) tasks: Focus on a single function or configuration
   - Medium (M) tasks: Implement a complete feature or component
   - Large (L) tasks: Implement complex subsystems
   - Extra Large (XL) tasks: Implement full pipelines or major components

4. **Maintain Incremental Progress**:
   - Ensure each task is fully functional before moving to the next
   - Write clean, well-documented code that follows the project's patterns
   - Include appropriate error handling

## Key Phase Objectives

- **Phase 0**: Setup & Familiarization with Agno
- **Phase 1**: Core Service Bridge & Orchestrator Skeleton
- **Phase 2**: Implementing Core Agents (Research, Analysis, Generator)
- **Phase 3**: Implementing Execution Agents (Integration, Testing)
- **Phase 4**: Rounding out Functionality (Documentation, Settings)
- **Phase 5**: Robustness, Performance, Final Integration
- **Phase 6**: Testing & Documentation (ongoing)

## Task Implementation Approach

1. Understand the task requirements from the task description
2. Review relevant existing code and documentation
3. Plan your implementation (classes, functions, interfaces)
4. Implement the minimal viable solution for the specific task
5. Add appropriate error handling and tests
6. Document your implementation

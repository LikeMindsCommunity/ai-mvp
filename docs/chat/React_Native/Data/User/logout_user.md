# Logout User

To disconnect a user (say that youâ€™re for instance logging out and logging in as someone new) you can call the `logout()` method present in `LMChatClient` class.

## Logging out

1. For an user to logout, use the `logout()` method of the client you initialised.
2. Pass in the `refreshToken` which is a required parameter.
3. Process the response of type `LMResponse<Nothing>` as per your requirement.

```ts
const payload: any = {
  refreshToken: "ENTER_REFRESH_TOKEN",
  deviceID: "ENTER_DEVICE_ID",
};

const response = await lmChatClient.logout(payload);

if (response.success) {
  // your function to process the response data
  processResponse(response);
} else {
  // your function to process error message
  processError(response);
}
```

## Overview

`LinkPreview` is a React component designed to display a preview of a link. It provides users with a visually engaging representation of the link's content, including elements like the title, description, and a thumbnail image. This component enhances user experience by making links more informative and clickable within chat or feed interfaces.

alt="LMFeedMediaPreviewScreen"
style={{border: '2px solid #d6d6d6', padding: '8px', width: '40%'}}
/>

## Customisations

The `LinkPreview` customisations can be done using [`chatBubbleStyles`](../Message/LMChatroomMessage.md/#customisations) as shown in the `Message` component.

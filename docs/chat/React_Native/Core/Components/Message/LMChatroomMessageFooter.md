## Overview

`MessageFooter` is a React component that serves as a footer for chat messages. It typically includes UI elements that enhance message interaction, such as options for replying, forwarding, or reacting to messages. The component is designed to improve user engagement by providing easy access to these functionalities directly beneath each message in a chat interface.

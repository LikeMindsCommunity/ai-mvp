## Overview

`MessageHeader` is a React component designed to display the header for chat messages. It typically includes information such as the sender's name, the time the message was sent, and potentially other relevant details. This component enhances the chat experience by providing context and clarity for each message, helping users to quickly identify who sent a message and when it was sent.

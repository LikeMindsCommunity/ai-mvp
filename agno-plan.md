Strategy to implement a robust and performant RAG-based agentic flow for our "LikeMinds Flutter Integration Assistant" using **Agno (by Phidata)** as the chosen framework.

Given Agno's description as a "minimalist framework" with "clean Python syntax" and "built-in cloud deploy features," our strategy will focus on leveraging its simplicity for defining individual agentic components and its potential for streamlined deployment, while being prepared to build out more complex orchestration and state management logic if Agno itself is unopinionated in those areas.

Here's a phased implementation strategy:

**I. Foundational Understanding & Setup (Agno Integration)**

1.  **Deep Dive into Agno (`docs.agno.com`):**
    * **Core Concepts:** Understand Agno's fundamental abstractions. Does it have explicit "Agent" classes, "Tool" integrations, "Workflow/Pipeline" definitions? How does it manage LLM calls and API interactions?
    * **Pythonic Integration:** Confirm how to define agent logic using Python. Look for examples of structuring tasks, inputs, and outputs.
    * **Tool Usage:** How does Agno facilitate calling external tools/APIs (e.g., `flutter` CLI, `git`, Supabase, Gemini API)? Does it have wrappers or expect direct Python `subprocess` or `httpx` calls within Agno tasks?
    * **Async & Performance:** Investigate its support for asynchronous operations (`async/await`). How does it handle potentially long-running tasks? Does it offer guidance or features for performance and scaling?
    * **Deployment:** Understand the "built-in cloud deploy features." Does this simplify deploying our Python-based agents? Does it integrate with existing Docker setups?
    * **State Management:** How does Agno handle state between steps or across different agent invocations? Is it stateless by default, requiring external state management (like our Supabase DB)?
    * **Minimalism vs. Completeness:** Assess which parts of our agentic plan Agno will directly support and where we'll need to implement custom logic or integrate other specialized libraries (e.g., for vector databases if Agno doesn't manage them).

2.  **Environment Setup:**
    * Install Agno and any necessary dependencies.
    * Create a new branch/module in your existing `ai-mvp-1` project for this Agno-based implementation to allow for experimentation without disrupting the current system.
    * Configure Agno to use your existing `.env` variables for API keys (Gemini, Supabase, GitHub).

3.  **Proof of Concept (Simple Agno Task):**
    * Implement a very simple Agno "task" or "agent" (based on its terminology) that takes a user query, calls the Gemini API for a basic completion, and returns the result. This will validate your understanding of Agno's basic workflow.
    * Attempt to deploy this simple task using Agno's cloud deployment features to understand the process.

**II. Implementing the RAG Pipeline with Agno**

Agno itself might not be a full RAG framework like LlamaIndex. It's more likely to be the framework that *calls* components of a RAG pipeline.

1.  **Document Ingestion & Processing:**
    * This will likely remain custom Python code as currently planned (using `gitingest`, text splitters, etc.). Agno's role here would be to potentially orchestrate these ingestion steps if they are run dynamically.
    * **Agno Task:** Create an `IngestProjectCodeAgent` (or an Agno task) that takes a `project_id`, clones/pulls the repo, runs `gitingest`, and stores/updates the `ingest.txt`.
    * **Agno Task:** Create a `ProcessDocumentationAgent` for your SDK docs if this needs to be dynamic.

2.  **Embedding & Vector Store Management:**
    * Use existing Python libraries for embeddings (e.g., `google-generativeai` for Gemini embeddings, or SentenceTransformers).
    * Interact with your chosen vector store (ChromaDB, or others) using their Python clients.
    * **Agno Task (if needed dynamically):** `UpdateVectorStoreAgent` that can process new documents/chunks, generate embeddings, and upsert them into the vector store.

3.  **Retrieval Agent within Agno:**
    * **Define as Agno Task/Agent:** `InformationRetrievalAgent`.
    * **Input:** Query (from Query Understanding Agent), number of results to retrieve, metadata filters.
    * **Logic:**
        * Embeds the input query.
        * Queries the vector store.
        * Potentially implements re-ranking logic (either custom or by calling another LLM via Agno).
    * **Output:** List of relevant document chunks with metadata.

**III. Building Core Agents as Agno Tasks/Components**

Structure each of our previously brainstormed agents as potentially one or more Agno tasks or logical units within an Agno application.

1.  **User Query Understanding & Planning Agent:**
    * **Agno Task/Agent:** `QueryPlannerAgent`.
    * **Input:** Raw user query, conversation history.
    * **Logic:** Uses an LLM (Gemini, via Agno's LLM call mechanism if available, or directly) with specific prompts to:
        * Analyze intent.
        * Break down the query into sub-tasks.
        * Identify keywords and context for the `InformationRetrievalAgent`.
    * **Output:** A structured plan (e.g., a list of steps, information to retrieve).

2.  **Project Context Agent:**
    * **Agno Task/Agent:** `ProjectContextAgent`.
    * **Input:** `project_id`.
    * **Logic:**
        * Interfaces with Supabase (direct Python client) to fetch project details.
        * Invokes `IngestProjectCodeAgent` if code needs to be ingested/updated.
        * Loads `ingest.txt` and potentially `pubspec.yaml` or other key project files.
    * **Output:** Structured project context (metadata, file summaries, etc.).

3.  **Code Generation Agent:**
    * **Agno Task/Agent:** `CodeGenAgent`.
    * **Input:** Refined query/prompt, retrieved documentation chunks, project context (including user's existing code snippets if applicable).
    * **Logic:**
        * Constructs a detailed prompt for the Gemini API.
        * Uses Agno's LLM call mechanism (or direct Gemini SDK call) to generate code.
        * Handles multi-file output format parsing (using your existing logic).
    * **Output:** Generated code (string or structured multi-file data).

4.  **Code Analysis & Validation Agent:**
    * **Agno Task/Agent:** `CodeAnalyzerAgent`.
    * **Input:** Generated code (multi-file), `project_id`.
    * **Logic:**
        * Writes code to the appropriate project-specific temporary directory.
        * Uses Agno's tool/subprocess feature (or direct Python `subprocess`) to run `flutter analyze`.
        * Parses the output.
    * **Output:** Analysis results (success/failure, list of errors/warnings).

5.  **Build & Preview Agent:**
    * **Agno Task/Agent:** `FlutterBuildAgent`.
    * **Input:** `project_id`, target platform (e.g., "web").
    * **Logic:**
        * Runs `flutter pub get` and `flutter build web` (or other build commands) in the project directory using Agno's tool/subprocess features.
        * If successful, starts the preview server (potentially another Agno task or a managed process).
    * **Output:** Build status, logs, preview URL.

6.  **Debugging & Refinement Agent:**
    * This might be part of the `QueryPlannerAgent`'s re-planning loop or a separate `CodeRefinementAgent`.
    * **Input:** Original query, generated code, analysis errors/user feedback.
    * **Logic:**
        * Constructs a new prompt for the `CodeGenAgent` incorporating the errors/feedback.
        * May re-invoke the `InformationRetrievalAgent` for more relevant context.
    * **Output:** A new attempt at generated code.

**IV. Orchestration, State, and Asynchronous Flow with Agno**

This is where Agno's "minimalist" nature will be tested.

1.  **Orchestrator / Meta-Agent:**
    * If Agno doesn't provide high-level orchestration primitives (like LangGraph's graphs or CrewAI's processes), you'll need to build this as a primary Python class/module.
    * This orchestrator will define the sequence of invoking the Agno tasks/agents defined above.
    * It will manage the overall state of an integration request (e.g., in Supabase, as per your audit recommendations).
    * **How Agno fits:** The orchestrator would *use* Agno to run individual, potentially cloud-deployed, agent tasks. For example, an `Orchestrator.handle_code_generation(query)` method would internally make a call to an Agno endpoint that triggers the `QueryPlannerAgent`, then `InformationRetrievalAgent`, then `CodeGenAgent`, etc.

2.  **State Management:**
    * Since Agno might be stateless for individual tasks, rely on your Supabase backend (`code_generations` table, `project_history` table) to store:
        * Conversation history.
        * State of each step in the agentic flow for a given user request.
        * Paths to intermediate artifacts (generated code files, analysis reports).
    * Each Agno task would fetch its required state from Supabase at the beginning and persist its results/state changes at the end.

3.  **Asynchronous Operations & Task Queuing:**
    * **Leverage Agno's Strengths:** If Agno's "built-in cloud deploy features" mean it can run Python functions as scalable, serverless-like endpoints, then each agent task could be an Agno-deployed function.
    * **External Queues (if needed):** If Agno tasks are synchronous or not suited for very long-running processes like a full Flutter build, you'll still need an external task queue (Celery, RQ, Arq) as suggested in your audit.
        * FastAPI endpoint receives user request via WebSocket.
        * Orchestrator enqueues a main task (e.g., `process_integration_request`).
        * The task worker (Celery worker) then calls individual Agno-deployed agent tasks or runs Agno applications.
    * **Streaming Results:** Results from Agno tasks (especially LLM streams or build logs) need to be streamed back. If Agno tasks are HTTP endpoints, they can use streaming responses. These would then be relayed via your FastAPI WebSocket to the client, or the client could connect to an SSE endpoint updated by the Agno tasks/orchestrator.

**V. Integration with Existing FastAPI Backend & WebSocket**

1.  The `api/presentation/websocket_handler.py` will initiate the agentic flow.
2.  Instead of calling `FlutterGeneratorServiceImpl` directly for the whole process, it would:
    * Create an initial task record in Supabase.
    * Invoke the main Orchestrator (which might enqueue a background job).
    * Return an immediate acknowledgment to the client with a task ID.
    * The client then listens for progress updates on a specific channel (WebSocket messages pushed by FastAPI, or SSE) tied to that task ID.
3.  Your REST APIs for project management, auth, etc., remain largely the same but will provide data to the Agno agents/tasks when needed.

**VI. Phased Implementation Plan (using Agno):**

* **Phase 1: Agno Setup & Core Agent Wrappers (Weeks 1-3)**
    * Complete Agno familiarization and PoC.
    * Wrap the core functionalities of `FlutterCodeGenerator` (Gemini calls) and `FlutterCodeManager` (analysis, file ops) as basic Agno tasks. Focus on making them callable, perhaps as deployed Agno endpoints if that's its model.
    * Implement the `InformationRetrievalAgent` using Agno, connecting to your RAG components (vector store, embedding).

* **Phase 2: Basic Orchestration & RAG Integration (Weeks 4-6)**
    * Develop a simple Python-based orchestrator that calls the Agno tasks from Phase 1 in sequence: Query -> Retrieve -> Generate -> Analyze.
    * Integrate this orchestrator with your FastAPI WebSocket handler (initially, this might still be somewhat synchronous or use basic `asyncio.create_task` for backgrounding within FastAPI before moving to a full task queue).
    * Refine the RAG pipeline components (chunking, metadata) and ensure they work smoothly when called by the `InformationRetrievalAgent`.

* **Phase 3: Adding More Agents & Asynchronicity (Weeks 7-9)**
    * Implement the `ProjectContextAgent`, `QueryPlannerAgent`, and `FlutterBuildAgent` as Agno tasks.
    * Integrate a proper task queue (Celery/RQ) if Agno's deployment model isn't sufficient for long-running, isolated tasks. The orchestrator will now dispatch jobs to this queue, and workers will execute Agno tasks.
    * Implement SSE or robust WebSocket push mechanisms for streaming updates from the agents/tasks back to the client.

* **Phase 4: Advanced Features & Robustness (Weeks 10-12)**
    * Develop the `Debugging & RefinementAgent` logic.
    * Implement comprehensive error handling, retries, and state tracking in Supabase for the entire agentic flow.
    * Focus on performance optimization of each Agno task and the RAG pipeline.
    * Conduct thorough testing of multi-turn conversations and complex integration scenarios.

* **Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (Ongoing)**
    * Utilize Agno's cloud deployment features for the agent tasks.
    * Set up logging, monitoring, and tracing for the Agno tasks and the overall orchestration.

**VII. Addressing Agno's Potential Limitations:**

* **Smaller Community/Fewer Plugins:** Be prepared to build more custom components and wrappers. Your existing `flutter_generator` code is a huge asset here. The focus will be on making these Python modules callable and manageable *by* Agno.
* **Orchestration:** If Agno is truly minimalist and lacks built-in complex workflow orchestration, your custom Python orchestrator becomes central. Agno then serves as a way to run/deploy the individual *skills* or *tools* that the orchestrator uses.
* **State Management:** Rely heavily on your Supabase backend for persistent state, as Agno tasks themselves might be stateless.

This strategy aims to use Agno for what it's good at (Pythonic task definition, potential deployment ease) while filling in gaps with your existing robust Python code and standard distributed system patterns (task queues, external state). The key will be the initial deep dive into Agno's capabilities to see how much it offers out-of-the-box versus how much "glue" code and custom logic you'll need to write.
